Hi! My name is Olga Dementey. Located in Minsk, Belarus. 

I'm a fast learner, eager to dive into new concepts and put them into practice. I'm highly motivated to become a part of a team and bring value to real projects. 

I have a solid knowledge of HTML, CSS (SCSS), JavaScript, Typescript and React (Next), as well as Git, Vite/Webpack, Vitest. Now I'm focused on deepening my knowledge of React and relevant technologies. 

I have a high level of English (B2+) and good communication skills.

This repository contains an app with my CV and portfolio projects.
