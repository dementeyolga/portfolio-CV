Hi! My name is Olga Dementey. Located in Minsk, Belarus. I'm a fast learner, eager to dive into new concepts and put them into practice. I'm highly motivated to study hard and become a part of a team. I have a solid knowledge of JavaScript and React (Next), now I'm focused on deepening my knowledge of React and relevant technologies. I have a high level of English (B2+) and good communication skills.

This repository contains an app with my CV and portfolio projects.
